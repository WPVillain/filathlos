# Filathlos

Filathlos Sports Lovers WordPress Theme based on Sage 9 and Bootstrap 4, Bedrock Boilerplate, Trellis WordPress Stack. This theme is still in progress and not production worthy. It is being developed in the open and anyone can contribute to it.

## Sage 9
Sage 9 Starters theme based so really state of the art with the latest techniques such as Yarn, Blade Templating, NPM and much much more. We will update the theme with the latest beta version from time to time.

## Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap 4 CSS Framework. Though in beta working really well. Bootstrap menu added as well as front-page.php with Bootstrap 4 carousel. Carousel is still a work on progress as is the rest of the site, but do stay tuned!

## Bedrock
Filathlos is using Bedrock. Bedrock is a WordPress boilerplate with better file structure, security through better password encryption using Bcrypt, access storage using Dotenv.

## Trellis
Trellis is our favorite WordPress provisioning and deployment stack which we use for most of our WordPress projects. It allows us to have development parity, quickly provision servers and do zero downtime deployments with Git from our Github repo.

## WooCommerce 3.0.7
WooCommerce 3.0.7 is supported and does work with dummy data from the WooCommerce plugin. Styling and adding of footer and header data is still in progress. We are now using the Blade templating engine for The WooCommerce's implementation.
